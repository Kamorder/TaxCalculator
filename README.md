# TaxCalculator
This program was mainly written to help my parents do their taxes for their business in a simpler way. To get the summaries for each section the formatted document needs to follow a specific naming scheme. It's name followed by the numeric values on the next line, this can include dollar signs and can include cent counts. In the end it will give you a separate document with all the summaries.

***NEW UPDATE SOON*** LaTex PDF rather than just a txt file...
"Name(No duplicates allowed and fully numeric names not allowed)"
For the numeric section under the following formats are acceptable. 


100, 200, 300, 400


or 


100


200


300.05


or


100 200 300


or 


$100 $200 $300


Example:


Gas


100 200 56.40 39.59



This then would print in the final document


Gas: $395.99
