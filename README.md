# TaxCalculator
This program was mainly written to help my parents do their taxes for their business in a simpler way. Inorder to get the summaries for each section the formatted document the user needs to put in a document which follow a specific naming scheme. It's name followed by the numeric values on the next line, this can include dollar signs and can include cent counts. In the end it will give you a separate document with all the summaries.

"Name(No duplicates allowed and fully numeric names not allowed)"
For the numeric section under the following formats are acceptable. 
100, 200, 300, 400
or 
100
200
300.05
or
100 200 300
or 
$100 $200 $300

Example:
Gas
100 200 56.40 39.59

This then would print in the final document
Gas: $395.99
